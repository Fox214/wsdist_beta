    # Hand-to-Hand weapon skills
    # Notice that each weapon skill has "-1" nhits.
    # This is to allow us to fit in an "off-hand" attack to get full TP, as observed in game.
    # Technically, the off-hand attack does not get any MA procs, but it does get full TP.
    # You could instead think of this as H2H is dual-wielding, with full TP and MA procs for first main+sub hits, but the sub-hit uses the same stats as the main hit since it's the same weapon.
    # Or you could say the first two main-hits get full TP, and there are no sub hits.
    # I treat it as dual-wield so the empyrean/mythic Aftermaths are treated properly in the code and so it's easy to calculate TP return from WSs
